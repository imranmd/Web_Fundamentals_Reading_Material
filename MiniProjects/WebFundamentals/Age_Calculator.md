**Assignment: Responsive Age Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

**Objective:**
Create a responsive age calculator web application that allows users to calculate their age based on their birthdate. You will also deploy this application using either Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Interface:**

   - Include a "Calculate Age" button.
   - Display the result (age) in a clear and visually appealing manner.

2. **Functionality:**
   - Implement the age calculation logic using JavaScript.
   - When the "Calculate Age" button is clicked, calculate the age based on the entered birthdate.
   - Display the age in years, months, and days.
   - Handle invalid input (future dates, non-date values, etc.) gracefully and provide clear feedback to the user.

3. **Responsiveness:**
   - Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

4. **Validation:**
   - Validate the birthdate input to ensure it follows the YYYY-MM-DD format.

- Include an animation or transition effect to make the user experience more engaging.
- Offer the ability to reset the calculation and enter a new birthdate without refreshing the page.

**Submission:**

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2. Commit your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the repository.
3. Create a `README.md` file with a brief description of the project and a link to the live deployment.
4. Deploy the project on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages and provide the live URL in the README.
