**Assignment: Responsive Dictionary App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

**Objective:**
Create a responsive dictionary web application that allows users to search for word definitions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will also deploy this application using Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages and use an open-source API to fetch word definitions.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Interface:**
   - Design a user-friendly and responsive interface for the dictionary app.
   - Include a search input field where users can enter a word to look up.
   - Implement a "Search" button for initiating the word search.
   - Display the word definition, part of speech, and example sentences clearly on the page.
   - Take inspiration from any of the online existing dictionaries

2. **Functionality:**
   - Use JavaScript to interact with an open-source dictionary API. You can use APIs like the Merriam-Webster API, Oxford Dictionaries API, or any other suitable dictionary API.
   - When the user enters a word and clicks "Search," fetch and display the word's definition, part of speech, and example sentences.
   - Handle cases where the word is not found or the API request fails gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user.

Please make sure to review the terms and conditions, rate limits, and usage policies of these APIs before integrating them into your dictionary app.

3. **Styling:**
   - Apply CSS to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.
   - Use fonts, colors, and layout techniques to create an attractive design.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the dictionary app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling for cases such as network errors or API request failures, providing informative messages to the user.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application on one of the following platforms: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Create a simple user guide or readme explaining how to use the dictionary app.

**Extra Credit (Optional):**

- Implement a feature to allow users to listen to the pronunciation of the word if the chosen API supports this feature.
- Add a "favorites" feature that allows users to save and revisit their searched words.
- Include auto-suggestions or auto-complete functionality as users type in the search input.
- Implement a dark mode or theme switcher for the app.

**Submission:**

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
