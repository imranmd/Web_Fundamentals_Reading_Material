**Assignment: Responsive IP Address Tracker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

**Objective:**
Create a responsive IP address tracker web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This assignment focuses on designing a user-friendly interface and implementing functionality to retrieve and display information about IP addresses. You will also deploy the application using Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages and use an open-source IP geolocation API.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Interface:**
   - Design a clean and user-friendly interface for the IP address tracker.
   - Include an input field where users can enter an IP address or domain name.
   - Implement a "Track IP" button for initiating the IP address lookup.
   - Display information about the IP address, including its location, region, country, and ISP.

2. **Functionality:**
   - Use JavaScript to interact with an open-source IP geolocation API. You can use APIs like "ipinfo.io," "ip-api.com," or any other suitable geolocation API.
   - Fetch and display the location-based information of the entered IP address or domain name.
   - Handle cases where the IP address is not found or the API request fails gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user.

some open-source IP geolocation APIs that you can use for your IP Address Tracker project:

    1. **ipinfo.io**:
    - API Documentation: [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/)
    - Description: Provides location, hostname, and other information about an IP address.

    2. **ip-api.com**:
    - API Documentation: [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com/docs/)
    - Description: Offers IP geolocation data including country, region, city, and more.

    3. **ipgeolocation.io**:
    - API Documentation: [ipgeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/documentation/)
    - Description: Provides geolocation data for an IP address, including country, region, and city.

    4. **extreme-ip-lookup.com**:
    - API Documentation: [extreme-ip-lookup.com](https://extreme-ip-lookup.com/static/api)
    - Description: Offers IP geolocation data including city, country, ISP, and more.

    5. **freegeoip.app**:
    - API Documentation: [freegeoip.app](https://freegeoip.app/)
    - Description: Provides IP geolocation information, including latitude and longitude.

    6. **ipstack**:
    - API Documentation: [ipstack](https://ipstack.com/documentation)
    - Description: Offers IP geolocation data, including city, region, and country.

    Please ensure to review the usage policies, terms, and rate limits of the selected API before implementing it in your project. Some of these APIs may have usage limitations for free access.

3. **Styling:**
   - Apply CSS to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.
   - Use fonts, colors, and layout techniques to create an attractive design.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the IP address tracker is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling for cases such as network errors or API request failures, providing informative messages to the user.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application on one of the following platforms: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Create a simple user guide or README explaining how to use the IP address tracker.

**Extra Credit (Optional):**

- Include a map displaying the approximate location of the IP address.
- Implement a dark mode or theme switcher for the app.
- Add a history feature to keep a record of previously tracked IP addresses.

**Submission:**

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2. Commit your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the repository.
3. Create a `README.md` file with a brief description of the project, instructions on usage, and a link to the live deployment.
4. Deploy the project on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages and provide the live URL in the README.
