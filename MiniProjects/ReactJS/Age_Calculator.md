**Assignment: Responsive Age Calculator using ReactJS**

**Objective:**
Create a responsive age calculator web application using ReactJS that allows users to calculate their age based on their birthdate. You will also deploy this application using Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

**Requirements:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Set up a new React application using Create React App or your preferred React configuration.

2. **User Interface:**
   - Design a responsive and user-friendly user interface for the age calculator.
   - Create an input field for users to enter their birthdate.
   - Include a "Calculate Age" button.
   - Display the result (age) in a clear and visually appealing manner.

3. **Functionality:**
   - Implement the age calculation logic using React components and state management.
   - When the "Calculate Age" button is clicked, calculate the age based on the entered birthdate.
   - Display the age in years, months, and days.
   - Handle invalid input (future dates, non-date values, etc.) gracefully and provide clear feedback to the user.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

5. **Styling:**
   - Apply CSS or use a styling framework like Material-UI to make the application visually appealing.
   - Use appropriate fonts, colors, and layout for a polished look.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application on one of the following platforms: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Create a simple user guide or README explaining how to use the age calculator.

**Extra Credit (Optional):**

- Add an option for the user to select their birthdate from a date picker.
- Include an animation or transition effect to make the user experience more engaging.
- Offer the ability to reset the calculation and enter a new birthdate without refreshing the page.

**Submission:**

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2. Commit your React application files to the repository.
3. Create a `README.md` file with a brief description of the project, instructions on usage, and a link to the live deployment.
4. Deploy the project on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages and provide the live URL in the README.

**Grading Criteria:**

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Functionality (40%)
- User Interface and Responsiveness (25%)
- Validation and Error Handling (15%)
- Styling and Presentation (10%)
- Deployment (10%)

**Important Notes:**

- You are encouraged to explore and experiment with different design elements and styles using React.
- Proper commenting and clean code will be appreciated.
- Plagiarism or using pre-made templates without customization will result in a lower grade.

Good luck with your project!
