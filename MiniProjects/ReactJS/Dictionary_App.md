**Assignment: Responsive Dictionary App using ReactJS, Redux, and Deployment**

**Objective:**
Create a responsive dictionary web application using ReactJS and manage state using Redux. This assignment focuses on designing a user-friendly interface and implementing functionality to retrieve word definitions. You will also deploy the application using Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages and use an open-source dictionary API.

**Requirements:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Set up a new React application using Create React App or your preferred React configuration.
   - Set up Redux for state management.

2. **User Interface:**
   - Design a clean, responsive, and user-friendly user interface for the dictionary app.
   - Include an input field where users can enter a word.
   - Implement a "Search" button for looking up the word.
   - Display the word's definition, part of speech, and example sentences clearly on the page.

3. **Functionality:**
   - Use React components and Redux for managing state to interact with an open-source dictionary API.
   - When the user enters a word and clicks "Search," fetch and display the word's definition, part of speech, and example sentences.
   - Handle cases where the word is not found or the API request fails gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

5. **Styling:**
   - Apply CSS or use a styling framework like Material-UI to make the application visually appealing.
   - Use appropriate fonts, colors, and layout techniques for a polished look.

6. **Redux State Management:**
   - Implement Redux for managing the state of the dictionary app. Define actions, reducers, and selectors for relevant data.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application on one of the following platforms: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Create a simple user guide or README explaining how to use the dictionary app.

**Extra Credit (Optional):**

- Implement a feature to allow users to listen to the pronunciation of the word if the chosen API supports this feature.
- Add a dark mode or theme switcher for the app.
- Include a history feature to keep a record of previously searched words.

**Submission:**

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2. Commit your React application, Redux code, and any CSS files to the repository.
3. Create a `README.md` file with a brief description of the project, instructions on usage, and a link to the live deployment.
4. Deploy the project on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages and provide the live URL in the README.

**Grading Criteria:**

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Functionality (40%)
- User Interface and Responsiveness (25%)
- Validation and Error Handling (15%)
- Styling and Presentation (10%)
- Redux State Management (10%)
