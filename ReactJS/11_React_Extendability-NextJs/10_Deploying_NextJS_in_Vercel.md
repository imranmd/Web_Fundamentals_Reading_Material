## Deploying a Next.js App on Netlify: A Step-by-Step Guide

Netlify is a popular platform for deploying and hosting web applications. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of deploying a Next.js app on Netlify, step by step.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. A Next.js application ready for deployment.

### Step 2: Set Up a GitHub Repository

Netlify allows seamless integration with Git repositories. If your app isn't already on a repository, create a GitHub repository and push your Next.js project to it.

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

1. Log in to your [Netlify account](https://www.netlify.com/).

2. From the Netlify dashboard, click the "New site from Git" button.

3. Choose your Git provider (e.g., GitHub) and select the repository where your Next.js app resides.

4. Configure your build settings:
   - Branch to deploy: Choose the branch you want to deploy (usually "main" or "master").
   - Build command: Enter the build command (e.g., `npm run build`).
   - Publish directory: Enter the directory containing the build output (usually `out` or `build`).

5. Click the "Deploy site" button.

6. Netlify will automatically start the deployment process. Once the build is complete, your Next.js app will be live on a Netlify-generated URL.

### Step 4: Accessing Your Deployed App

The URL provided by Netlify is where your Next.js app is hosted. You can visit this URL in your web browser to access your deployed app.

### Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain, you can easily configure it with your Netlify deployment:

1. From the Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings" > "Domain management."

2. Under "Custom domains," click "Add custom domain" and follow the instructions to configure your domain.

### Step 6: Continuous Deployment

Netlify supports automatic deployments whenever you push changes to your Git repository. This feature ensures that your app is always up to date without manual intervention.

1. Under "Site settings," go to "Build & Deploy."

2. Under "Continuous Deployment," enable "Build hooks" or connect your repository directly to enable automatic deployments.

### Summary

Deploying a Next.js app on Netlify is a straightforward process that takes advantage of Netlify's integration with Git repositories.
