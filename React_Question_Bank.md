## Beginner Questions: \[10 Points\]

**1\. Create a React component named Header that renders an element with the text "Welcome to My App!"**

**2\. Define a React component named Button that renders a button element with the text "Click Me."**

**3\. Why choose the React Framework over other frameworks such as Angular or VueJS? What are the advantages?**

**4\. What is the difference between Virtual DOM and Shadow DOM?**

**5\. Difference between UseMemo and UseCallback?**

**6\. Difference between State and Prop?**

**7\. Build a functional component named UserCard that takes two props, name and email, and displays them inside a <div> element.**

**8\. Create a parent component called App that renders three instances of the UserCard with different data.**

**9\. Develop a component called Toggle that renders a button with the text "Toggle" and an initial state of true. When clicked, the button should toggle the state between true and false, and display the current state as text.**

**10\. Build a component with a text input field. Use the useState hook to store the input's value and update it as the user types.**

**11\. Develop a component that displays the current date and time. Update the display every second using the setInterval function inside the useEffect hook.**

**12\. What are Pure Components? When should we use Pure components? Write a sample code snippet for the same.**

**13\. What is the useEffect hook? When should we use it? Provide a couple of use cases along with one sample code snippet.**
