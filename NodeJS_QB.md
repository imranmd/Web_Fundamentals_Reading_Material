## Mentor Interview Guidelines:

- Use combination of Easy/Medium/Hard[1+2+1 or 4+3+0 or 3+1+1]
- For each question try to grind on writing the code snippet
- Nudge the candidate on Why and When part of concept

## Intermediate[20 Points]: [Duration: 5 mins -20 mins/ Question]

1. Implement a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for a resource (e.g., "tasks") using Node.js and Express.js.
2. Implement a simple authentication middleware in Node.js and Express.js that checks if a user is logged in before allowing access to certain routes.
3. Create a basic chat application using Node.js and Socket.io, allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time.
4. What are the differences between synchronous and asynchronous code execution in Node.js, and when would you use each?
5. What is the purpose of middleware in Express.js, and how is it used in building web applications?

## Advanced[50 Points]: [Duration: 20 mins -40 mins/Question]

1. Write a Node.js program that performs user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
2. Build a middleware in Node.js and Express.js that logs request and response data, including headers and payload.
3. Implement user session management using cookies and the express-session middleware in an Express.js application.
4. Develop a RESTful API rate limiting middleware in Node.js to prevent abuse of your API endpoints.
5. Write a function in Node.js that reads a CSV file, processes its data, and stores it in a database.
6. Develop a real-time chat application with user authentication using Node.js, Express.js, and WebSocket (e.g., Socket.io).
7. Develop Advanced Authentication Middleware in NodeJS with below tasks:
   - Create an Express.js middleware for user authentication.
   - Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication.
   - Handle token validation, user authorization, and token expiration.
   - Secure routes using this middleware, allowing access only to authenticated users.
